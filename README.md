Aref Ruqaa
==========

![Sample](documentation/sample.png)
Aref Ruqaa is an Arabic typeface that aspires to capture the essence of
the classical [Ruqaa] [1] calligraphic style.

The Latin part is based on [AMS Euler] [2], but spaced for regular text
rather than mathematics.

Aref Ruqaa is a work in progress and is not yet ready for wider use.
