Aref Ruqaa
==========

![Sample][sample]

Aref Ruqaa is an Arabic typeface that aspires to capture the essence of the
classical [Ruqaa][ruqaa] calligraphic style.

The Latin part is based on [AMS Euler][euler], but spaced for regular text
rather than mathematics.

Aref Ruqaa is a work in progress and is not yet ready for wider use.
